  about: >
    As part of Megathonâ€™17, we introduced a social challenge which was around Women
    Safety and Cyber Crime. Although it was limited only to Hyderabad students, we were
    really inspired by the innovative solutions that were proposed. Motivated by the success
    last year and a deep desire to take it to national level, we decided to take the same
    problem, which still remains one of the most pressing issues of today.

    In this edition, we are looking for all kinds of solution (and not just limited to
    technology) that could be useful to address this problem. The whole idea behind this is to
    find solutions that can be implemented and/or taken to the market. Hence, we shall be
    partnering with different govt. agencies (like the Hyderabad Police She Team) and NGOs
    who shall help us in this aspect.

    We really want to make our small contribution to this important issue and hope for a safer
    nation for women.
